Last night I received a text from Chinese low-cost carrier [Spring Airlines](http://www.china-sss.com/) notifying me that my flight from Shanghai to Beijing had been cancelled.

A [quick look on their website](/images/beijing.png) seems to suggest all their Shanghai – Beijing flights have been cancelled over the Spring festival period.

Somewhat annoying for me because apparently the refund will take between 2 and 6 months to come back. I guess I should have already learnt this lesson when I lost £500 when one day Oasis Hong Kong, a defunct long-haul budget airline that operated a flights between London, Hong Kong and Vancouver, [ceased to exist](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/1307946/Oasis-Hong-Kong-Airlines-goes-into-liquidation.html).

But I wonder if this is an early sign of struggle for the [only Chinese low cost carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Airlines).

**Update: We got the money back :).**
