[FT Chinese's MBA Gym (¥12 / £1.49)](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/ft-shang-xue-yuan/id493892004?mt=8) has been chosen by Apple for the App Store China's “Best of 2012” and is right now number 20 in the App Store China paid app chart (or in 2nd position if you exclude games).

This is quite an achievement given the Chinese market's reluctance to pay for content and that Apple would actually feature a wrapped HTML5 app so highly.
