I never expected that I’d have to stand for the National Anthem of the People’s Republic of China in a West End theatre in London but then again I guess they don’t have West End plays in Mandarin very often…

This evening I had the unique opportunity of watching the world’s [longest running play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mousetrap) in London in Mandarin. I could only follow about half of what was going (yet [another reminder](/2012/08/the-importance-of-tones-in-mandarin-chinese/) to work on improving my 普通话) on but was more than enough to understand the story.

“Although The Mousetrap has been licensed in foreign countries worldwide, this is the first time a foreign performance troupe has been invited to give a performance at St. Martin’s Theater,”

“捕鼠器”中文版是个很好看的话剧，我居然能看懂一半以上希望回中国能看更多的中文话剧。可是我没想到我会在伦敦西区(West End)剧院听到中国国歌
